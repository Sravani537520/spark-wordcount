 HTML Tags that Deal with Text HTML Tutorial Chapter Christopher Heng thesitewizardcomIn this chapter HTML tutorial series will learn more about HTML tags entities other paraphernalia that deal with textIf have only just arrived this site with intention learning HTML please start first chapter tutorial This article youre looking actually chapter Those know anything about creating websites should read Make Create Your Website Beginners Guide before anything elseLanguage Your Website Character Encoding Character Sets Content TypeWhen type some text characters into file your computer file including things like HTML files characters saved letters alphabet file series numbers actually more technical than that down electronic level above loose description will purposes example type letter into plain text file your editor actually saves number into file When display that file text editor browser other program reads number interprets displays suchThe problem that does intrinsically mean other thing computer means only program reading expects text file using particular language encoded using specific system that preagreed everyone computer world this system happens mean small letter lowercase different system different character technical lingo mean some other letter some other alphabetSince page contain language world encoded using character browser needs know both language your page uses well character using order display text correctlyOne specify language that your page uses attribute will recall from chapter this HTML tutorial your entire page proper enclosed between addition language attribute specifying that content page English will result HTML code from previous chapter looking like followingMy First PageThis sample page from thesitewizardcoms HTML tutorialNotice that instead plain have added space after html part added additional words probably obvious attribute lang specifies language page written portion after equals sign enclosed quotation marks specifies language Since sample page uses English have specified language your page uses German will have uses French will need specify probably have already noticed cant just specify language name after lang need find actual code that language list language names found here Remember enclose name quotation marks before placing after langApart from language attribute HTML also need specify character that your page uses This done adding into your HEAD section your page uses English only basic English alphabet numbers punctuation marks specify ISO88591 character inserting following line into your HEAD section dont know what mean inserting line into HEAD section should review chapter again where taught insert TITLE into that section procedure sameAlternatively preferred many people also specify UTF8 Unicode character insteadThe UTF8 character supports languages including English fact ISO88591 character just subset UTF8 dont know which choose specify UTF8 character Youll have less trouble that especially some indeterminate point future suddenly decide some accented character character that does occur basic English alphabet Remember that there actually some words English language that these accented characters Before many thesitewizardcoms pages ISO88591 character thats historical reasons Historical reasons this context saying that created site this many years when didnt know better still process converting those pages UTF8There other ways specify your language character besides inserting them into your page example also possible configuration option your server server computer program that your host uses your website However since this HTML tutorial will deal with that method here case actually good practice specify your language your page This your page will still valid change hosts forget configure serverNote that does have closing tagWith addition attribute specifying your pages language well META specifying character your page complete minimal page That minimum elements that required valid page That course doesnt mean that what want your website simply means that page have considered valid HTML page with required elements Theres obviously still more learnAlthough this outside scope HTML tutorial after inserting character META into your document should also make sure that your editor saves your document appropriate character That using UTF8 character make sure that your editor UTF8 encoding Unfortunately this done varies from editor editor difficult specific here since there zillion editors around Some editors have Encoding Format option Save dialog which appears when click Save line File menu where select appropriate character Others require into their configuration options there Please ignore this paragraph dont your editor save same encoding declared meta some things your page displayed with wrong characters with question mark rectangular block browser even looks perfect your editorReprise TagNow that weve declared language character that page going start using HTML tags that pertain manipulation textWe have already paragraph chapter youre already familiar with this perhaps because skipped chapter please return that chapter read mention this here only completenessIf remember used start paragraph your page browsers when encountering usually start text following your line page Since always starts paragraph cannot nest tags inside each other That want paragraph close existing paragraph with before using tagIn addition have carried experiments mentioned previous chapter youd have noticed that your page other content just above your paragraph browsers usually leave blank line before starting your paragraph This brings question place some text directly line beneath current without leaving blank line that between paragraphs when example poet want publish your poetry your page your verses page without leaving huge gaps between each line This function next that were going learnThe TagThe used when want what follows line without actually starting paragraph Take look following HTML code example simplify examples from will only show code relevant tags explaining That wont show things like section tags other tags that understood every page youre sure what these other tags please read chapter section aboveHad heavens embroided clothsEnwrought with golden silver lightThe blue dark clothsOf night light halflightI would spread cloths under your feetBut being poor have only dreamsI have spread dreams under your feetTread softly because tread dreamsInsert above poem William Butler Yeats into your page started chapter reload page your browser effect Notice that each line stanza occupies line page would expect poem which like think being short line break forces everything that follows lineNotice that there closing Since merely creates line does signal start something paragraph does does need does have closing tagPage Section HeadingsWhat wanted heading your page example visible title above poem HTML provides numerous tags this purpose namely action following line your page blank line just above opening poem inserted aboveCloths Heaven YeatsReload page your browser examine resultsThese tags have following characteristicsUse LowerNumbered Header Tags FirstBasically signals highest level header page Many webmasters display title page have divided your page into sections with some paragraphs containing their title those paragraph titles those paragraphs have subparagraphs need title them onIn other words should header with smallest number first before using with larger number example thesitewizardcoms pages title page used titles each section page such words Page Section Headings find beginning this section titles subsections within these sections heading LowerNumbered Header Tags First that above enclosed within pairPut Your Header Text Within PairAs will have probably observed from example header tags come pairs like paragraph tags example signals start header text browser signals itPut Header Outside Paragraph TagNotice that told header outside paragraph block header part paragraph Header paragraph tags what known HTML blocklevel tags browser formats content place within such tags block example each paragraph stands distinct block your page header likewise places text enclosed within separate block with formatting which topic next pointAppearance Header BrowsersBrowsers typically display text contained between header tags that stands some page Most browsers this putting headers bold smaller numbered headers like usually displayed with larger fonts distinguish between smaller numbered headers those with bigger numbers browsers render larger numbered headers using smaller fontsBefore control appearance headers like rest your page done using Cascading Style Sheets such finetuning appearance header tags will only taught later chapters this tutorial series chapters choose which header tags based current appearance example dont choose particular header level because size want Sizes text such things changed later Choose header according level header appears level headers should Headers level lower should appearance headers always changed laterBy reassurance that know that really change text enclosed header tags that they appear want take look thefreecountrycoms pages example Budget Hosting page words Budget Hosts Page actually enclosed tags They orange purple background because added rules specify that colour color different variant English combination that header tags words underneath Cheap affordable commercial hosts were simply enclosed tags special HTML tags were used those effectsTo reiterate choose appropriate header tags your titles according function those titles play your page according appearance those tags currently confer appearance changed later using CSSEmphasizing Text Putting Text Bold ItalicsThere occasions where want emphasize particular word group words your page Emphasis achieved using following HTML tagsThe tagThe pair tells browsers that enclosed text emphasized some know browsers display such text italics Note that doesnt that text italics just tells browsers that emphasized However seems that major browser vendors render display such text italicsThe tagThe pair tells browsers that sandwiched text strongly emphasized browsers today know display such text bold Again this display text bold browsers just practice that browser vendors adopted tags themselves mean bold anything like thatThere however some things should note about these tagsDo them stylistic purposesDo these tags purpose changing appearance words that they look prettier your page example dont text these tags just that higher numbered header tags like displayed bold mentioned before things that pertain appearance your page should modified using choosing HTML tags that happen cause your text take certain appearanceUse tags only really want certain things emphasized example words first line paragraph above draw attention principle learn here that should HTML tags function those tags suggest Appearance changes sake making page look good done patient Well dealing with eventually need learn HTML first because assumes prior knowledge HTMLDo block level tags within these tagsIf have entire paragraph that want emphasize example give warning about consequences taking some action should always your andor tags inside your paragraph tagsFor example following code illustrates correct these tagsThe strong placed within this exampleThis should beThe code below incorrect because places paragraph tags inside tagsThis code invalid itThe tags inline tags tags block tags Block tags contain number inline tags inline tags cannot contain block tagHow Insert Angle Brackets Other Special CharactersSince angle brackets like used flag start HTML tags might wondering actually insert such characters into your page without browser mistaking example insert less than sign mathematical expression like insert left angle bracket inserted typing without quotes into your pageLike angle brackets ampersand special character treated differently from other characters browsers flags start sequence characters known HTML standard character entity reference most commonly used character entity references followslt belownbsp space character belowcopy copyright symbol trade trademark character such thesitewizardAs have guessed once defined ampersand special character that begins character entity reference need tell browser when really need ampersand hence creation another character entity reference represent ampersand itself other words when need type ampersand your page dont type Type without quotesThe nbsp character entity reference represents nonbreaking space sure youve noticed when carried your experiments chapter when space between words your page browser wrap second word onto line runs space current line have pair words that must always placed together same line nbsp without quotes between those words instead normal space character force browser always keep those words together This character entity reference also useful when need more than space between words Again found chapter whenever more than space character between words browsers will remove additional space characters from output that always with only space displayed really need extra space characters whatever reason will need insert nbsp every space character want displayed instead multiple space charactersOther Less Used HTML Tags Presenting TextThere other HTML tags pertaining text that used your documents Most webmasters dont them here that find usefulDisplaying snippets computer code tagThe tags used when want display some computer code these tags this HTML tutorial series HTML tags example words this sentence sandwiched between tags browsers typically display such text monospaced fixed pitch fontQuoting someone tagsIf youre quoting someone place that quote inside either tags youre quoting paragraph more text youre just quoting short phrase middle your sentence more technical lingo block that include paragraph tags within opening closing tags while inline like that cannot enclose block level tagsYou example action article Things Aware When Writing English Content International Audience quote from Oscar Wilde beginning that article placed within pair browsers typically indent content marked tagged this waySuperscripts subscripts tagsIf need superscripts flag footnote represent expressions like emc2 pair enclose text want raised Subscripts like produced placing character characters between Both inline tagsPreformatted text tagIf enclose block text using tags youre telling browser that your text already formatted state Most browsers will preserve formatting your text asis leaving your white spaces lines exactly entered them Browsers also typically wrap lines that long into width browser window Note though that browsers required exhibit this behaviour behavior certain variants English ones that have tested Your text also usually displayed using monospaced fontThis pair often used display computer programming source code where formatting important best abuse your normal paragraphs textThe block level tagIndicating deleted text tagIf want indicate that certain word phrase sentence longer relevant enclose between pair example this word deleted been marked using pair browsers typically strike word words tagged this wayThere other HTML tags that rarely used webmasters They listed below completeness sake although doubt most will ever themCitations this include reference your sourceDefinition youre defining some term other mark your definition with this tagAcronym this acronyms used your page Webmasters using this usually title attribute elaborate what acronym means example acronym scuba this sentence been marked scuba Attributes will taught later chapter this tutorialAbbreviations Those with love abbreviations this mark them your page Like acronym people using this typically optional title attribute expand abbreviation example abbreviation HTML this sentence been marked HTML mentioned earlier will deal with attributes later chapterSample output Sample output from computer program placed within pairKeyboard input youre indicating that something typed keyboard mark with this tagVariable computer programmers youre computer programmer discussing source code computer program your page possible mark your variables using this tagDocument changes This counterpart mentioned earlier While indicates text that have been deleted indicates words phrases sentences that have been insertedAfter looking through list some probably thinking Chris what does browser show when these tags simple find your page load your browser results However would suggest that question actually misses point these tags HTML tags meant describe type content youre typing your page They meant prescribe appearance Appearance page meant controlled HTML tags Cascading Style Sheets cause those HTML tags make your text take appearance like with default appearance really relevant curious lazy reader some above tags simply text monospace fixed pitch font while others dont change appearance your text allDo have memorise these tags that happen things like abbreviations remember them appropriately practice webmasters bother example words like HTML used liberally throughout thesitewizardcom dont recall tagging even single instance them with pair other than example above fact quite possible without knowing tags mentioned this entire subsection course want your abbreviations displayed brown then simplest just them create rule that tells browser display abbreviations brownHow About Fonts Other Snazzy Design FeaturesFor those holding your breath waiting finally round talking about change fonts your page youll have wait longer Font changes considered things that govern appearance your page thus done using Cascading Style Sheets HTML Although there ways change fonts using HTML those methods deprecated which world computers basically means that they outdated will eventually removed from standardAs such well talk about fonts when part this tutorial seriesDo Interweave Different TagsNow that know enough cause problems important that learn important rule writing HTML code otherwise youll creating invalid HTMLThe easiest explain this rule example Consider following HTML code snippetthesitewizardcom tutorial website webmastersNotice that thesitewizardcom enclosed within both tags such most browsers that word will displayed both bold italics Observe carefully order opening closing tags innermost starting that closest thesitewizardcom matched innermost closing Just outside that pair tags pair opening matched closing same outer levelNow look following invalid HTML codeThis code errors spot problemThe innermost matched innermost closing Instead browser parsing that sentence encounters unexpected Although might think that managed closing tags into your page opening closing tags really same level mixing opening closing tags random order causes code invalid like writing mathematical expression with following bracket structure25 1Even assume that type bracket used mathematical expression above expression still makes sense because brackets jumbled instead matching each other correct level same HTML code with opening closing tags jumbled mess also makes senseNote that just because browsers often able decipher mess that some webmasters create with interwoven opening closing tags different types doesnt mean that such code valid Remember that browsers required parse display invalid code want They cannot expected read your mind after depend browsers telepathic know browser that caused display code think should displayed When that fixed browser vendors bugs their browsers time your page will longer appear intended itBut spot errors your page After like deliberately create invalid page Obviously made error must have been through either ignorance carelessness such they very hard spot especially dont even know they were errors first place This topic next sectionHow Check Your Page Errors Validating Your CodeThe easiest your HTML code checked through something known validator HTML validator computer program that looks your pages errors that violate HTML standard will spot things like jumbled tags that mentioned above well other types errors There many free HTML validators around some which download install your computer others where access only when youre connected InternetNote that HTML validators only check HTML errors They will check your English spelling your English grammar whether your page looks nice They merely check have

down results page read more about errors validator found your page detailed information gives exact line number column number error your page along with description what error isIncidentally used Validate Direct Input will always warning telling that validator assumed that your page uses UTF8 character encoding Since copied pasted your code directly into validator using this method validators page itself uses UTF8 character encoding your copiedandpasted text will always using UTF8 whether your real page actually uses this encoding browser transparently converts your text into UTF8
